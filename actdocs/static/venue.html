<h2>International Students House</h2>

<p>This year's workshop will be held at <a href="https://www.ishvenues.uk/">International Students House</a>, in Great Portland Street. An event space in central London supporting the educational needs of young people around the world. We have hired both the Gulbenkian and the Club Room, allowing us to run two tracks for up to 80 attendees each.</p>

<h2>Location &amp; Getting There</h2>

<p>International Students House is located <a href="https://g.page/ishvenues">a two minute walk</a> from Great Portland Street tube station in central London, accessible via the Hammersmith &amp; City, Circle, and Metropolitan Lines. Access is also possible via the Bakerloo Line (using Regent's Park station) or the Victoria or Northern Lines (using Warren Street station). The tube provides easy access to all major train stations in London, so we recommend using it to get to the venue regardless of whether you are coming from London or traveling into it.</p>

<h2>Where to stay</h2>

<p>We suggest making use of London's excellent public transport network. Budget hotel chains in the UK are Travelodge, Holiday Inn Express and Premiere Inn, but there are also lots of other large hotel chains, as well as small independant places. If you to spend less, look for hotels outside of zone 1. The Metropolitan and Victoria Lines are express lines that can get you into the city and directly to the venue.</p>

<p>To use the public transport in London you don't need to buy any tickets. You can tap with your phone or credit card when you enter and leave stations, or when you get on the bus. There is <a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/fares/find-fares/tube-and-rail-fares/pay-as-you-go-caps" target="_blank">a daily fare cap</a> that comes in handy if you want to do some touristing as well. Make sure you always use the same payment method for every journey. The tube as well as trains and buses in London are frequent and reliable, but it can get very busy during rush hour.</p>

<p>Planning your journeys in London works well with Google Maps. TFL offers their own <a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/plan-a-journey/" taret="_blank">journey planner</a> and they also have smartphone apps. A very popular alternative is <a href="https://citymapper.com/" target="_blank">Citymapper</a>. All of these use the same open data format, so they will all show you correct data, but may offer different routes depending on their feature set.</p>
