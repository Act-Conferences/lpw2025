<h2>The Trampery at Old Street, London</h2>

<p>This year's workshop will be held at <a href="https://thetrampery.com/spaces/venue-hire/">The Trampery</a>, at Old Street. A dedicated modern event space in central London. We have hired both The Ballroom and The Library; allowing us to run a main track for up to 160 attendees, and second smaller track for up to 35 attendees. A third room is available, The Study, which holds 15 people. This can be used as a breakout space and for open sessions, BOFs, hackathons, etc.</p>

<h2>Location &amp; Getting There</h2>
<p>The Trampery in Old Street is located <a href="https://g.page/thetrampery?share">a two minute walk</a> from the Northern Line's Old Street tube station in central London. The Northern Line has stops at most of the major train stations in London, or trivial links to others, so we recommend taking the tube to get to the venue.</p>

<h2>Where to stay</h2>
<p>The Old Street area is located between the City of London and Shoreditch. Unfortunately, that part of London is not known for cheap hotels. There are a few hotels very close to the venue, but they are rather on the pricy end.</p>
<p>We suggest making use of London's excellent public transport network. Budget hotel chains in the UK are Travelodge, Holiday Inn Express and Premiere Inn, but there are also lots of other large hotel chains, as well as small independant places. If you to spend less, look for hotels outside of zone 1 along the Northern Line.</p>
<p>To use the public transport in London, you don't need to buy any tickets. You can tap with your phone or credit card when you enter and leave stations, or when you get on the bus. There is <a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/fares/find-fares/tube-and-rail-fares/pay-as-you-go-caps" target="_blank">a daily fare cap</a> that comes in handy if you want to do some touristing as well. Make sure you always use the same payment method for every journey. The tube as well as trains and busses in London are frequent and reliable, but can get very busy during rush hour.</p>
<p>Planning your journeys in London works well with Google Maps. TFL offers their own <a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/plan-a-journey/" taret="_blank">journey planner</a> and they also have smartphone apps. A very popular alternative is <a href="https://citymapper.com/" target="_blank">Citymapper</a>. All of these use the same open data format, so they will all show you correct data, but may offer different routes depending on their feature set.</p>
