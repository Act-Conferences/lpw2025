        <h3>16/10/24 07:06 by <a href="/lpw2024/backup/user/10652">Lee Johnson</a></h3>
        <p> <p><p>
It's a little over a week until this year's <a href="https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/backup/">London Perl and Raku Workshop</a>. Here's a couple of things to note about the day.
</p></p>
<p><p>
The <a href="https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/backup/schedule?day=2024-10-26">schedule</a> is relatively fixed at this point, however if you haven't already starred the talks you plan to attend then please do so as this will inform any tweaks. The venue has a large room (150 people) and a smaller room (35 people) therefore it is helpful to know which talks might be heavily attended in advance so we can make sure those talks have enough space.
</p></p>
<p><p>
The <a href="https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/backup/venue.html">venue</a>, The Trampery in Old Street, is located a two minute walk from the Northern Line's Old Street tube station in central London. The Northern Line has stops at most of the major train stations in London, or trivial links to others, so we recommend taking the tube to get to the venue.
</p></p>
<p><p>
The venue will open at 9am, or a little before then, and talks are scheduled to start at 9:30am. There will be some opening snacks for those who skipped breakfast, and coffee, tea, and water will be available throughout the day without the need for dedicated drinks breaks. We have planned 10min between each talk, allowing ample time for refills.
</p></p>
<p><p>
Attendees are expected to make their own plans for lunch. Although the area nearby is busy during the week, it's quiet at the weekend, and there are plenty of options in the immediate area. We will have an afternoon snack break at about 3pm.
</p></p>
<p><p>
The <a href="https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/backup/">London Perl and Raku Workshop</a> will take place on 26th Oct 2024. Thanks to this year's sponsors, without whom LPW would not happen:

        <h3>30/09/24 13:45 by <a href="/lpw2024/backup/user/10652">Lee Johnson</a></h3>
        <p> <p><p>
This year's <a href="https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/backup/">London Perl and Raku Workshop</a> is just 4 weeks away. We now have a <a href="https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/backup/schedule">pretty full schedule</a>, so the call for presentations is now closed, however we might have room for one or two more talks depending circumstances on the day. If you really think you have talk you want to give then <a href="http://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/backup/team.html">get in touch</a>.
</p></p>
<p><p>
As part of the workshop we would like to ask attendees if any are willing to volunteer for helping out on the day. This will likely include:
<ul>
<li>Room monitoring and video equipment operation</li>
<li>Registration of attendees</li>
<li>General assistance of organisers and attendees</li>
</ul>
</p></p>
<p><p>
We are probably looking for three people to help out on the day. Please contact the <a href="http://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/backup/team.html">organisers</a> if you would like to help out.
</p></p>

        <h3>04/09/24 07:28 by <a href="/lpw2024/backup/user/10652">Lee Johnson</a></h3>
        <p> <p><p>
The <a href="https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/backup/schedule">schedule</a> for this year's London Perl & Raku Workshop is now visible: <a href="https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/backup/schedule">https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/backup/schedule</a>. Please please please (please please) make a point to mark those talks that you plan to attend as this will allow us to tweak the schedule a bit if some talks are more heavily favourited than others.
</p></p>
<p><p>
The venue opens for attendees at 9am and we plan to start talks at 9:30am. Drinks will be available throughout the day, hence no need to have dedicated breaks there. Lunch will be at midday for an hour, there are plenty of options close to the venue to grab something to eat. If we receive a couple more sponsors we can have lunch at the venue, but currently that won't be possible.
</p></p>
<p><p>
There are a couple of spots left for talks, otherwise the schedule is full. Please don't let this put you off submitting a talk as it's possible some speakers may have to change their plan. 
</p></p>
<p><p>
You'll note that there are three "Open Sessions" in the The Study. This room can hold 15 people seating with room for a presenter. We can host a breakout, BOF, hackspace, whatever you suggest. There will be no recording facility in this room, but if no suggestions are made we will likely use it to schedule some of the remaining talks.
</p></p>

        <h3>29/08/24 07:38 by <a href="/lpw2024/backup/user/10652">Lee Johnson</a></h3>
        <p> <p><p>
Hi All! Given the number of talks submitted to this year's <a href="https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/backup/talks">London Perl & Raku Workshop</a> we have decided to reserve a third room in the <a href="https://thetrampery.com/spaces/venue-hire/old-street/">venue</a>. This will give us a bit more room on the schedule for talks, which is good as the other two rooms are now 90% full.
</p></p>
<p><p>
However, we would also like to use this third room for something else. Its capacity is relatively low, 15 people including the person presenting, so we feel it might be suitable for use as a breakout room / mini hackathon(s) / birds of a feather; and we will probably reserve two large slots for this. If you have an idea of something you'd like to use the room for then please get in touch with us.
</p></p>
<p><p>
Another way we can make more space for talks is to opt for lunch at the venue, this will free up space for three more talks. To do that we need a couple more sponsors so if you would like to help with that then please have a look at the options here: <a href="https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/backup/sponsoring.html">https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/backup/sponsoring.html</a>

        <p> <p><p>
Yep, that's right - the second half dozen talks have been accepted for this year's <a href="https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/backup/talks">London Perl and Raku Workshop</a>. This puts our schedule at approximately 80% full, so if you are thinking about talking at the workshop then <a href="https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/backup/newtalk">submit your proposal now</a>!
</p></p>
<p><p>
The CFP will be closed at the end of September to give speakers sufficient time to finish their presentations and to allow the schedule to be created. We encourage all attendees to <a href="https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/backup/talks">mark talks they are interested in</a> as that will inform some of the schedule choices.
</p></p>
<p><p>
If you aren't thinking about talking then have a think about what you've been doing in the Perl and/or Raku space the last five years, or even just the general IT and development space. Perhaps there's something interesting you can talk about? If you don't feel it's a full fat talk then submit a lightning talk instead.

        <p> <p>The London Perl & Raku Workshop (LPW) will take place this year on Saturday 26th October and you are encouraged to submit your talk proposals now. We have already had 30 registrations for the workshop so we anticipate a good turnout this year.</p>
<p>We welcome proposals relating to Perl 5, Raku, other languages, and supporting technologies. We may even have space for a couple of talks entirely tangential as we are close to finalising the venue (very central London) and should have room for two tracks.</p>
<p>Talks may be long (40mins), short (20 mins), or very short (aka lightning, 5 mins) but we would prefer talks to be on the shorter side and will likely prioritise 20min talks. We would also be pleased to accept proposals for tutorials and discussions. The deadline for submissions is 30th September.</p>
<p>We would really like to have more first time speakers. If you’d like help with a talk proposal, and/or the talk itself, let us know - we’ve got people happy to be your talk buddy!</p>
<p>Register (it's free!) and submit your talk on the <a href="https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/backup/">workshop site</a>.</p>
<p>We would also like to make a call for sponsors - does your company want to support the workshop? By sponsoring LPW you can demonstrate your support for the Perl and/or Raku languages and nurture your relationship with the local developer community. Much more information can be found <a href="https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/backup/sponsoring.html">on the workshop site</a> along with a <a href="https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/backup/pdf/lpw_2024_sponsor_prospectus.pdf">sponsor prospectus</a>.</p>
<p>As well as the benefits as listed on the aforementioned page, sponsors will all feature in blog posts, news posts, social media posts. That starts right now, with our first sponsors who have already generously sponsored the workshop:</p>

        <p> <p>We're aware that some users are not receiving emails when trying to register, sign up, or reset their passwords.</p>
<p>It appears that some email providers are rejecting the mails from ACT, if you try again (and, as usual, check spam) you might succeed. The alternative is to try an different address.</p>
<p>We are looking into the issue and hope to have this fixed soon.</p> </p>  <h2><a href="http://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/backup/news/1697">Announcing The London Perl &amp; Raku Workshop 2024 (LPW)</a></h2>
        <h3>22/04/24 10:34 by <a href="/lpw2024/backup/user/10652">Lee Johnson</a></h3>
        <p> <p>Hey All,</p>
<p>Yes, we're back we'd like to announce this year's LPW:</p>
<p><a href="https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/backup/">https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/backup/</a></p>
<p><strong>WHEN</strong>: TBC, most likely Saturday 26th October 2024<br />
<strong>WHERE</strong>: TBC </p>
<p>Please register and submit talks early - it gives us a better idea of numbers. The date is tentative, depending on the venue, but we'd like to aim for the 26th October 2024.</p>
<p>This will be the 20th anniversary of LPW (in terms of years, not number of events). We might try to do something special...</p>
<p>The venue search is currently in progress. The 2019 venue has turned into a boarding school so we can't use that any more due to safeguarding issues. We don't want to go back to the University of Westminster so we are searching for a venue.</p>
<p>If you can help out with the venue search that would be great - does your company have a large enough space to host us? Are you part of a club, organisation, university, school, etc that can provide space? Have you been to an event in central London recently that might be a suitable venue?</p>
<p>Here's roughly what we're looking for. Obviously requirements are a little flexible:</p>
<p><ul>
<li>Central London (Zone 1)</li>
<li>Saturday 26th October 2024</li>
<li>Available 9am to 5pm (with access 8am to 6pm)</li>
</ul></p>
<p><ul>
<li>A main lecture hall / room with presentation facilities</li>
  <ul><li>To seat at least 100 people  + With PA system</li></ul>
<li>Optional second room, also with presentation facilities</li>
  <ul><li>To seat at least 35 people</li>
   <li>Breakout room (optional) / reception / welcome area for stands/registration</li></ul>
</ul></p>
<p><ul>
<li>Video facilities are <strong>not</strong> required</li>
</ul></p>
<p><ul>
<li>Catering facilities are required</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Tea, coffee, water, soft drinks, small snacks throughout the day</li>
    <li>Possibly lunch provided on site with dietary requirement options </li>
    <ul><li>However if lunch is a significant cost we will leave people to sort that out themselves</li></ul>
    </ul>
</ul></p>
<p>Please register, submit talks, think about possible venues, and <a href="mailto:organisers@londonperlworkshop.org">let us know via email</a>.</p>
<p>Cheers!<br />
