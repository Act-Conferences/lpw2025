DESCRIPTION:Perl Diver is a system for taking various measurements about th
 e quality of your Perl code and producing reports from that data. This hap
 pens automatically\, using GitHub Actions and GitHub Pages.\n\nDepending o
 n how the next six months go\,  this will either be a vaguely handwavey ta
 lk about concepts and plans - or it will be a bit of a sales pitch with lo
 ts of demos.

 s immediate challenges\, how it is currently being used\, and how it can h

 6 redesign process. Damian actively helped revise it to RakuDoc v2. Why bo
 ther? Using an extensible tool that uses the AST of a RakuDoc source to re

 ps\, Graphs\, Latex formulas\, specifying text in one place\, using it in 
 others\, aliases\, automatic Table of contents\, tables embedding tables. 
 How to create custom blocks.

  binary data manipulation with concurrent representation on a terminal win
 dow.  Examples of how this may useful both for fun and study are provided.

DESCRIPTION:The recent upsurge in functional programming techniques for web
  development has been lead by new languages such as Elm (which compiles to
  JS) and serves a need to simplify front end design to help improve collab
 oration and streamline maintenance. This talk will present the new Raku HT
 ML::Functional module (written by the presenter)\, show how it follows the
  functional approach of Elmlang but is more suited for backend server side
  page assembly. A practical example of functional HTML in action will be d
 emonstrated that uses HTMX\, Pico CSS and Raku Cro on the server side.

DESCRIPTION:Massification of higher education results in large class size i
 n learning and teaching environment\, and another fact is that\, in engine
 ering education\, there are a number of modules that are taught by simulat
 ion\, and report submission is done by uploading a pdf/doc file to online 
 system. It is therefore challenging to reduce the academic misconducts in 
 university.  \n\nInspired by the idea of test automation in Perl/Raku\, a 
 study on coursework question design is conducted by randomizing the parame
 ters in coursework questions. The method combines tools in GNU/Linux\, suc
 h as Perl/Raku\, GNU/Octave\, LaTex\, pdfunite\, and etc\, and it can prod
 uce exam paper and exam solution at the same time. The automation in marki
 ng process is also investigated based on the result of question design aut
 omation.

DESCRIPTION:Chemometrics with Perl & Pharmaceutical Applications\n\nAndrew 
 J. O’Neil PhD\nDirector\, Nirmetrix Limited\, 20-22 Wenlock Road\, London\
 , N1 7GU\, U.K.\n\nThe extensive functionality of the Perl language and it
 s clear\, C-like syntax make it a good choice for scientific data analysis
  and also for development of software with a graphical user interface (GUI
 ).\n\nThis work demonstrates the use of Perl in analytical\nchemistry\, sp
 ecifically near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy\, a non-destructive\, non-inva
 sive\, rapid method of chemical analysis. \nExample applications of Perl f
 or pharmaceutical\nanalysis are reported.\n\nA portable\, handheld NIR spe
 ctrometer (model NIR-S-G1\,\nInnoSpectra Corporation) is controlled by a G
 UI written in\nPerl/Tk. Resulting spectra are simultaneously interpreted w
 ith results reported instantaneously to the end-user.\n\nNIR absorptions a
 rise due to overtone vibrations of chemical bonds that are approximate\nmu
 ltiples of the fundamental mid-infrared absorption frequencies (i.e. first
 \, second and\nthird overtones) or are combination bands of several fundam
 ental vibrations’ frequencies.\nReduction in reflected incident light inte
 nsity by a material at a given wavelength\, relative\nto that from a non-a
 bsorbing\, diffusely-reflecting standard (e.g. sintered PTFE) occurs due\n
 to absorption by one or more covalent bonds of the material studied. Bonds
  that absorb in\nthis region of the electromagnetic spectrum generally inv
 olve hydrogen covalently bonded\nto either: carbon\, oxygen or nitrogen. M
 ost organic molecules\, including pharmaceutical\nactive ingredients\, thu
 s show absorptions in this region.\n\nAn NIR spectrum of a chemical-sample
  is a multivariate data array of N-reflected\nintensities of light at disc
 rete wavelengths (i.e. 1-by-N) across the wavelength range\n(approximately
 : 900 – 1\,700 nm). With many variables (wavelengths) in a spectrum\n(betw
 een one and several hundreds of wavelengths)\, interpretation of a spectru
 m or a\ncollection of spectra requires multivariate analysis (termed chemo
 metrics).\n\nThis work illustrates the use of Perl twofold. The first appl
 ication is for control of the open-\nsource scientific computing programmi
 ng language GNU Octave\, to generate multiple NIR\ndata calibration models
  for quantification of analyte (i.e. pharmaceutical active ingredient).\nT
 hese multivariate-regression models are produced by calibration of NIR dat
 a with\nreference analytical method concentration data\, using the partial
  least squares regression\n(PLSR) algorithm. Various mathematical data pre
 treatments are applied to the NIR spectra\nand\, in combination\, subsets 
 of wavelength regions are also utilised in the data modelling.\nThe combin
 ed effects of these on the accuracy and precision of calibration is determ
 ined.\nThe aim of this data modelling is to select a model with high accur
 acy and precision.\nThe second application of Perl is for control of the N
 IR spectrometer. A Perl/Tk developed\nGUI is used to control the handheld 
 NIR spectrometer\, enabling acquisition of: background spectra of the refe
 rence reflectance standard (for instrument response calibration) and\nthen
  of spectra of chemical samples. The GUI enables interpretation of the acq
 uired\nspectrum on-the-fly\, for a qualitative (i.e. identification) or qu
 antitative chemometric model.\nPerl scripts load ASCII text arrays – previ
 ously developed\, optimised GNU Octave\nchemometric model and chemical-sam
 ple spectrum – and perform multivariate analysis.\nThe GUI then reports to
  the end-user the required metric for either identification (along\nwith a
  pass/fail result) or analyte quantification. This therefore obviates the 
 need for the\nend-user to perform chemometrics.\nThe presentation will inc
 lude illustration of the use of Perl for NIR analysis of pharmaceuticals a
 nd for several applications.

DESCRIPTION:Many are still composing their SQL queries dangerously by assem
 bling their queries with string interpolation.\n\nNot only are such querie
 s slow and prone to errors\, they are also loopholes for injections.\n\nBu
 t many legacy projects are full of such examples. And refactoring is often
  not easy.\n\nAnd even today many developers choose interpolation\, since 
 it’s a core feature in Perl and comfortable to use.\n\nThis talk shows a c
 urrent project to convert such interpolations to placeholders\, without lo
 sing the benefits of ease and expressiveness.\n\nWe will cover and explain
  some in-depth techniques like\n\n- Callbacks in DBI.pm\n- Manipulating va
 riables with PadWalker.pm\n- Bind variables with tie\n- Overloading operat
 ors for objects\n\nThis is an extended and updated version of my talk at Y
