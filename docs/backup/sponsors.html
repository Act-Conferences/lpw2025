				<p><a href="https://tech.deriv.com/">Deriv</a>, a leading online broker with 25 years in the industry, is proud to sponsor the London Perl &amp; Raku Workshop 2024.</p>

				<p>As a company with strong ties to the Open Source community, our connection to Perl is more than just practical—it's a passion. Over the years, we have actively used Modern Perl and contributed to shaping its future, including beta testing key developments like Object::Pad, which are crucial for advancing the language's capabilities.</p>

				<p>Perl is the backbone of our back-end operations, proving to be a robust, reliable, and versatile language that meets our needs. Its community-driven growth, notably through CPAN, continually boosts its capabilities and reflects our values of collaboration and innovation.</p>

				<p>At Deriv, we apply Perl across various areas, from microservices with Myriad to complex asynchronous event-driven programming through our work on Net::Async. Our involvement also includes developing and sharing modules that work with Postgres, Redis, and Slack, improving the Mojolicious framework, and handling specialized financial services tasks such as modeling market trends and managing cryptocurrency transactions.</p>

				<p>Sponsoring the London Perl &amp; Raku Workshop shows our commitment to this vibrant community. We are eager to connect with fellow Perl enthusiasts, share our experiences, and explore new advancements together. This event is a cornerstone for collaborative development and innovation, and we look forward to contributing to and celebrating the ongoing evolution of Perl and Raku. Join us as we continue to support and nurture the growth of these powerful programming languages.</p>

</div></div>

<p>Perl Careers is a Perl-focused recruitment consultancy, run by a CPAN contributor with a recruitment background, rather than by a non-technical person. I can understand the skills you're looking to hire for, make sense of your GitHub profile, and offer specific Perl-related career and salary advice. I am very picky about only recruiting for companies I'd want to work at, and placing candidates who I'd want to work with. I'd love to talk to you if you think you might be either.</p>

<p>If you're a candidate and you'd like a second pair of eyes on your CV or résumé, want a confidential run-down on a company you're thinking of applying for (whether or not we work with them), want some recommendations on what employers are looking for, or want to know if you're being paid properly, I'd be happy to have an informal chat.</p>

<p>If you're a hiring manager and you'd like some advice on your job ads, some thoughts on free and paid channels for advertising for candidates, guidance on market salaries, or if you're non-technical and just need some help fleshing out what your actual requirements are, I'd be happy to have a commitment free chat.</p>

<p>Most of the candidates I place weren't actively looking for roles, and weren't available to traditional recruiters. Many of the most rewarding companies to work for aren't actively looking to hire, but if a recruiter who understands the candidate's strengths and the company's needs puts them together, they'll find a place.

			<p>Perl developers are hard to get. As the leading language of the dotcom boom, Perl is one of the best-paid languages worldwide, yet Perl training seldom features on university curricula. But that doesn't have to cause a headache for employers trying to expand their Perl team.</p>
			<p>Geekuni can give software developers with no previous Perl experience the training they need, as they need it. So, whether you’re looking to provide new recruits with online Perl training from day one of the onboarding process or upskill existing talent, Geekuni has the training package to empower your staff with Perl.</p>
